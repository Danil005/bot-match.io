You will never have to pay in the bot to see who liked you and find mutual sympathy, everything will be absolutely free and limited only by hardware so that there are no spammers, but for this we will ask you to support our โpossibleโ future sponsors and maybe we will keep on donations! At the moment, the best support for us will be to order a boost from @boost_ace',
